# Rubric

The project's rubric is divided into two sections: Write Up and Execution.

## Write Up

| Success Criteria | Specifications |
| --- | --- |
| Scoping the Project | The write up includes an outline of the steps taken in the project. The purpose of the final data model is made explicit. |
| Addressing Other Scenarios | The write up describes a logical approach to this project under the following scenarios:<ul><li>The data was increased by 100x.</li><li>The pipelines would be run on a daily basis by 7 am every day.</li><li>The database needed to be accessed by 100+ people.</li></ul> |
| Defending Decisions | The choice of tools, technologies, and data model are justified well. |

## Execution

| Success Criteria | Specifications |
| --- | --- |
| Project code is clean and modular. | All coding scripts have an intuitive, easy-to-follow structure with code separated into logical functions. Naming for variables and functions follows the PEP8 style guidelines. The code should run without errors. |
| Quality Checks | The project includes at least two data quality checks. |
| Data Model | <ul><li>The ETL processes result in the data model outlined in the write-up.</li><li>A data dictionary for the final data model is included.</li><li>The data model is appropriate for the identified purpose.</li></ul> |
| Datasets | The project includes:<ul><li>At least 2 data sources</li><li>More than 1 million lines of data.</li><li>At least two data sources/formats (csv, api, json)</li></ul> |

## Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out

To make your project stand out:

- [ ] Work with large amounts of data.
- [ ] Combine datasets that are difficult to combine.
- [ ] Enrich the data from several disparate sources.
- [ ] Include recommendations for how to use to data to come up with insights.
- [ ] Write a blog post about your project and link to it.
