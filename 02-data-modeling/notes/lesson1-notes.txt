2. What is Data Modeling
Data Modeling - The process of creating data models for an information system.

DDL - Data Definition Language

5. Intro to Relational Databases
Relational Model - Organizes data into one or more tables (or "relations") of columns and rows, with a unique key identifying each row. Generally each table represents one "Entity type" (such as customer or product).

Relational Database - "... is a digital database based on the relational model of data ... a software system used to maintain relational databases is a relational database management system (RDBMS)"

Structured Query Language - used across almost all RDBMS to interact with the database

The Basics
- Database/Schema - Collection of Table
- Tables/Relations - A group of rows sharing the same labeled elements
- Columns/Attributes - Labeled element
- Rows/Tuple - A single item

7. When to use a relational database
Advantages
- Ease of use
- Ability to do JOINS
- Ability to do aggregations and analytics
- Smaller data volumes
- Easier to change business requirements
- Flexibility for queries
- Modeling the data, not modeling queries
- Secondary indexes available
- ACID Transactions - data integrity
- Easier to change business requirements

8. ACID Transactions
ACID Properties - properties of database transactions intended to guarantee validity even in the event of errors, power failures
- Atomicity - The whole transaction is processed or nothing is processed
- Consistency - Only transactions that abide by constraints and rules is written into the database otherwise database keeps previous state
- Isolation - Transactions are processed independently and securely, order does not matter
- Durability - Completed transactions are saved to the database even in cases of system failure

9. When Not to Use a Relational Database
- Large amounts of data
- Need to be able to store different data type formats
- Need high-throughput
- Need a flexible schema (columns added that don't need to be used by every row)
- Need high availability - database where there is very little downtime
- Need horizontal scalability (add more machines/nodes to increase performance)

Scale is limited to vertical upgrades

10. What is PostgreSQL
- Open source object-relational database system
- Uses and builds on SQL language

14. NoSQL Databases
- NoSQL = not only SQL = NonRelational
- Types:
    - Apache Cassandra (Partition Row Store)
    - MongoDB - Document Store
    - DynamoDB - Key-Value Store
    - Apache HBase (Wide Column Store)
    - Neo4J - Graph Database
- Basics of Apache Cassandra
    - Keyspace - Collection of Tables (Database)
    - Table - Group of Partitions
    - Rows - A Single item
    - Partition
        - Fundamental unit of access
        - Collection of row(s)
        - How data is distributed
    - Primary Key
        - Primary key is made up of a partition key and clustering columns
    - Columns
        - Clustering and Data
        - Labeled element

15. What is Apache Cassandra?
- "... provides scalability and high availability without compromising performance. Linear Scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the perfect platform for mission-critical data."
- Uses its own query language CQL

16. When to Use a NoSQL Database
- Large amounts of data
- Need horizontal scalability
- Need high throughput -- fast reads
- Need a flexible schema
- Need high availability
- Need to be able to store different data type formats
- Users are distributed -- low latency

17. When Not to Use a NoSql Database
- Need ACID Transactions
- Need ability to do JOINS
- Ability to do aggregations and analytics
- Have changing business requirements
- Queries are not available and need to have Flexibility
- Have a small dataset

** MongoDB now offers Multi-Document ACID Transactions
