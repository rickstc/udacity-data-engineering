## Project Abstract

The project narrative instructs the student that they have been tasked by a music streaming startup called Sparkify to develop a database schema and ETL pipeline for their streaming platform. This schema and pipeline would be developed utilizing the platform's user logs (JSON) and song metadata (JSON), with the end goal of being able to better understand user listening preferences.

The student is to complete the boilerplate project code to define fact and definition tables representing a star schema and populate the tables using the JSON provided in the [data directory](docs/data.md).
